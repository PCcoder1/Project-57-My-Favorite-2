        <p> When I was a kid, I didn't really live near the ocean. So I did not know what it was like, and thought of it as a scary place. However, when I moved to California, we had more frequent visits to the beach, since we were so close to the shorre. I loved the water, and it's animals. I loved playing in the sand. That is when my parents got me intrested in swimming. And I love it. I love going there every week, swimming and splashing around in the water. And now, I am really good at swimming. And, the good part is, I really love it, and doing something you enjoy, can make it fun. </p>
